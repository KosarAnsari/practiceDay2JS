# practiceDay2JS - JavaScript DOM Manipulation

Welcome to practice 2 of my javaScript learning journey!
Today, I practiced **DOM ( Document Object Model) Manipulation** -
specifically focusing on different methods to access and manipulate
HTML elements using JS.

## 📚 Topics Covered
### DOM Accessing methods
Here are the key methods
explored to access HTML elements:

- `getElementById()`
- `getElementsByClassName()`
- `getElementByTagName()`
- `querySelector()`
- `querySelectorAll()`

## 🧪 What I Practiced
### ☑️ Accessing Elements by ID
### ☑️ Accessing Elements by Class Name
### ☑️ Accessing Elements by Tag Name
### ☑️ Using querySelector
### ☑️ Using querySelectorAll

🎯 Goal
To understand how JS can 
interact with HTML elements
dynamically, and how we can select,
style, and manipulate them using 
different DOM accessing methods.
